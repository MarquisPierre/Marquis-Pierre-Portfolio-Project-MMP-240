        <h3> About Me</h3>
        <p> My name is Marquis Pierre and I have intrest in many things like anime, manga, and music. I never really got deep into coding because I found it quite a difficult task, but a year later I've gotten a deep intrest for it. I didn't know there were so many programming languages! Getting off of the topic of coding; I like to play the guitar and listen to loud music. I also have an interest in learning diffrent languages like Japanese and French, so on my free time i like to learn them. I also like to draw for fun on my free time. I love obtaining new hobbies because it allows me to say "I have a life".
        Curently I am self studying programming languages to become a web deveolper in the near future.

       <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p> I don't have a lot of skills in my opinion but I know the essentials of a couple of adobe softwares like Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premeire Pro, and adobe XD. I also understand the basics of HTML and CSS. I am currently teaching myself Javascript and plan to either learn Python or Java right after.</p>
